    db_log_verify: verifies the log files of a database
    db_printlog: converts database log files to human readable text
    db_recover: is used to restore a database to a consistent state after a failure
    db_replicate: is a daemon process that provides replication/HA services on a transactional environment
    db_stat: displays database environment statistics
    db_tuner: analyzes the data in a btree database, and suggests a page size that is likely to deliver optimal operation
